The tissue that has a free surface is called **epithelial tissue**. This free surface may face either a body fluid (such as blood, lymph, or mucus) or the outside environment.

**Characteristics of Epithelial Tissue:**

* **Free Surface:** The cells have an exposed surface that faces either a body fluid or the external environment.
* **Apical Surface:** The surface facing the external environment or body cavity.
* **Basal Surface:** The surface attached to the connective tissue below.
* **Closely Packed:** The cells are closely packed together with minimal intercellular space.
* **Polarized Cells:** They are generally polarized, with different apical and basal surfaces and functions.
* **Basement Membrane:** The basal surface is supported by a basement membrane, which separates the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue.
* **Avascular:** Epithelial cells are avascular, meaning they lack blood vessels. They receive nutrients from the underlying connective tissue through diffusion.

**Functions of Epithelial Tissue:**

* **Protection:** Forms a physical barrier against pathogens, chemicals, and physical damage.
* **Secretion:** Secretes various substances, such as mucus, enzymes, and hormones.
* **Absorption:** Facilitates the uptake of substances from the external environment or body fluids.
* **Excretion:** Helps eliminate waste products from the body.
* **Sensory:** Contains specialized cells that detect changes in the environment and transmit sensory information.

**Additional Context:**

Epithelial tissue is classified into different types based on its structure and function. Some of the common types include:

* **Simple Epithelium:** Consists of a single layer of cells.
* **Stratified Epithelium:** Consists of multiple layers of cells.
* **Glandular Epithelium:** Specialized for secretion of substances.

The question asks about cell junctions, which are structures that connect adjacent cells in multicellular organisms. The answer given is ""All of the above,"" which refers to the three statements provided as options:

a) Cell junctions are sites of material exchange between adjacent cells.
b) Tight junctions prevent the leakage of materials between the cells.
c) Gap junctions provide channels for direct cytoplasmic connections between adjacent cells.

**All three statements are correct:**

a) **Cell junctions are sites of material exchange between adjacent cells:** This is a crucial function of cell junctions. Cells can exchange nutrients, ions, and other molecules directly with their neighbors through these junctions.

b) **Tight junctions prevent the leakage of materials between the cells:** Tight junctions are specialized cell junctions that create a tight seal between adjacent cells. This prevents the uncontrolled movement of substances between the cells, maintaining the integrity of the tissues and organs.

Connective tissues are a type of tissue that connects, supports, and protects other tissues and organs in the body. They are composed of three basic components:

1. **Cells:** Connective tissues contain specialized cells called fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing and secreting the protein fibers and ground substance.

2. **Protein fibers:** These fibers provide strength and support to the connective tissue. The most common types of protein fibers are collagen, elastin, and reticular fibers.

3. **Ground substance:** The ground substance is a gel-like substance that fills the space between the cells and protein fibers. It contains a variety of proteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans that provide hydration, support, and protection to the tissue.

Each type of connective tissue has a different combination and arrangement of these three components to suit its specific function. For example, tendons, which connect muscles to bones, have a high proportion of collagen fibers for strength and flexibility, while cartilage, which lines the joints, has a high proportion of ground substance for lubrication and shock absorption.

**Additional context:**

* Connective tissues are classified into six main types based on their structure and function: loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue, cartilage, bone, blood, and lymph.

**Explanation:**

The supportive skeletal structures in the human external ears and in the nose tip are examples of cartilage. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found throughout the body. It is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and other proteins.

Cartilage is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support and protection to the body. It is also found in the joints, where it helps to reduce friction and wear. Cartilage is not as hard as bone, but it is more flexible and elastic. This makes it ideal for use in areas where flexibility is important.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the role of cartilage in the human external ears and nose tip:

* **External ears:** The external ears are made up of a thin layer of skin that is supported by a framework of cartilage. This cartilage gives the external ears their shape and allows them to move.
* **Nose tip:** The nose tip is also made up of a thin layer of skin that is supported by a framework of cartilage. This cartilage gives the nose tip its shape and allows it to move.

Cartilage is an important tissue that plays a vital role in the structure and function of the human body. It is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support, protection, and flexibility.

**Additional context:**

* Cartilage is classified into three types: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage.
* Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, nose tip, and external ears.
* Elastic cartilage is found in the ears and epiglottis. It is more flexible than hyaline cartilage.
* Fibrocartilage is the strongest type of cartilage. It is found in the intervertebral discs and menisci of the knee.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various parts of the body, such as the joints, ears, and nose. It is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of extracellular material.

The matrix of cartilage consists primarily of water, collagen fibers, and a protein called chondrin. Chondrin is a type of glycosaminoglycan, which is a complex sugar molecule that contributes to the elasticity and compressibility of the cartilage.

Chondrin is responsible for providing the structural support and resilience to cartilage. It interacts with collagen fibers to form a reinforcing network that can withstand compression and tensile forces. This network allows cartilage to protect and cushion underlying tissues, such as bones and joints, while also providing flexibility for movement.

The primary function of a camel's hump is to store adipose tissue, not water. Adipose tissue is composed of fat cells, which are specialized cells that store triglycerides, a form of energy storage.

When the camel needs additional energy, such as during food shortages or long journeys, it can access the triglycerides stored in its hump. This process involves breaking down the triglycerides and releasing fatty acids, which are then oxidized to produce energy.

**Additional Context:**

The camel's hump is a unique adaptation that allows it to survive in harsh desert environments where water and food are scarce. It is located on the back and can weigh up to 80 pounds.

In addition to storing adipose tissue, the camel's hump also acts as an insulator, helping to regulate the animal's body temperature.

The hump also provides structural support for the camel's body, enabling it to carry heavy loads.

**Explanation**

Neural tissue is a type of tissue that makes up the nervous system. The unit of neural tissue is the neuron, which is a specialized cell that is capable of transmitting electrical signals throughout the body. Chondrocytes, on the other hand, are cells that make up cartilage, which is a type of connective tissue. Chondrocytes are not excitable cells, and they do not play a role in the transmission of electrical signals.

Here is a breakdown of the other statements in the question:

**A). Neurons are the structural and functional unit of the nervous system**
- This is true. Neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system, and they are responsible for transmitting electrical signals throughout the body.
**B). Neuroglia provide structural and nutritional support to the neurons**

They are associated with **areolar connective tissue**, which is a loose, irregularly arranged type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin and the submucosa of the digestive tract. Mast cells are important for the body's immune response, as they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators when they are activated.

Here are some additional details about mast cells and areolar connective tissue:

* Mast cells are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. They circulate in the blood and then migrate to tissues where they are needed.
* Areolar connective tissue is a type of loose connective tissue that is characterized by its loose, irregular arrangement of collagen fibers. It is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin, the submucosa of the digestive tract, and the stroma of organs.
* Mast cells are activated by a variety of stimuli, including allergens, cytokines, and physical trauma. When they are activated, they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. This leads to increased blood flow and the accumulation of fluid and white blood cells in the affected area.
* Mast cells play an important role in the body's immune response. They are involved in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In innate immunity, mast cells release histamine and other inflammatory mediators that help to recruit other immune cells to the site of infection. In adaptive immunity, mast cells present antigens to T cells, which helps to activate the adaptive immune response.

* In frogs, the buccal cavity is the first part of the digestive system. It is lined by a moist epithelium that helps in respiration.
* When a hole is punched in the floor of the buccal cavity, it creates an opening between the buccal cavity and the lungs.
* This allows air to enter the lungs directly, bypassing the nose and mouth.
* As a result, the frog can still breathe and will not die.

**Additional Context:**

* Frogs have three main modes of respiration: cutaneous (through the skin), buccal (through the buccal cavity), and pulmonary (through the lungs).
* Pulmonary respiration is the most efficient and is the primary mode of respiration in adult frogs.

**Myogenic Heart:**

* The heart of a frog is myogenic, which means it can initiate and conduct electrical impulses on its own, without external stimulation.
* The generation of electrical impulses in the heart is regulated by a special group of cells called the sinoatrial node (SA node), which acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart.

**3-Chambered Heart:**

* The frog's heart consists of three chambers:
    * Two atria (right and left)
    * One ventricle

**Additional Context:**

* The frog's heart is a double circulatory system, meaning blood passes through the heart twice in one complete circuit of the body.
* The first circuit carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for gas exchange, and the second circuit carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.
* The heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.
* After gas exchange in the lungs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium and is pumped to the rest of the body through the aorta.

**Explanation:**

Simple epithelium is a thin layer of cells that covers the surface of the body or lines the cavities of internal organs. It is composed of a single layer of cells that are closely packed together. Simple epithelium is not vascularized, meaning it does not contain blood vessels. This is because the cells of simple epithelium are so thin that they can receive nutrients and oxygen from the underlying connective tissue by diffusion.

Vascularization is the process of supplying blood to a tissue or organ. It is essential for providing nutrients and oxygen to the cells of the tissue or organ. Simple epithelium does not require vascularization because its cells are so thin that they can receive nutrients and oxygen from the underlying connective tissue by diffusion.

The other statements about simple epithelium are correct. Simple epithelium is avascular, meaning it does not contain blood vessels. It is composed of a single layer of cells that are closely packed together.

The brush border epithelium is a specialized type of epithelium that lines the small intestine. It is characterized by the presence of numerous microvilli, which are small finger-like protrusions. These microvilli increase the surface area of the epithelium, which allows for the efficient absorption of nutrients from the digested food.

The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption in the human body. It is divided into three regions: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The brush border epithelium is present in all three regions, but it is most prominent in the jejunum and ileum.

The brush border epithelium is composed of a single layer of tall columnar cells. The cells are connected by tight junctions, which prevent the passage of materials between the cells. The apical surface of the cells is covered in microvilli. The microvilli are lined with glycoproteins, which provide a sticky surface for the absorption of nutrients.

The brush border epithelium also contains a number of goblet cells, which secrete mucus. The mucus helps to protect the epithelium from damage by digestive enzymes.

**Additional Context:**

* The brush border epithelium is also found in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney.
* The brush border epithelium is a highly dynamic structure that is constantly being renewed. The cells of the epithelium are shed every few days and replaced by new cells.

Epithelial tissue is a type of animal tissue that covers the body's surfaces and lines internal organs. It is characterized by its close-fitting, tightly packed cells and its ability to divide and regenerate throughout life.

**Reasons why Epithelial Tissue has Power of Division and Regeneration:**

* **Basal Cells:** Epithelial tissue typically contains a layer of basal cells at its base. These basal cells are actively dividing and producing new cells.
* **Stem Cells:** Epithelial tissue often contains stem cells, which are unspecialized cells that can differentiate into different types of specialized cells. These stem cells contribute to the tissue's ability to regenerate and repair itself.
* **Rapid Turnover:** Epithelial cells are constantly exposed to wear and tear, so they need to be replaced regularly. The rapid turnover of epithelial cells allows the tissue to maintain its integrity and function.

**Examples of Epithelial Tissue Regeneration:**

* Skin: Skin cells are constantly dividing and replacing damaged or dead cells. This process keeps the skin healthy and protected.
* Digestive Tract: The epithelial lining of the digestive tract is constantly renewed to protect against digestive enzymes and other harsh chemicals.
* Respiratory Tract: The epithelial lining of the respiratory tract traps foreign particles and protects the lungs. It regenerates regularly to maintain its protective function.

**Importance of Epithelial Tissue Regeneration:**

The ability of epithelial tissue to divide and regenerate is essential for maintaining the health and function of the body. It allows for:

* Tissue repair after injury
* Replacement of worn-out or damaged cells
* Protection against infection and environmental factors

**Additional Context:**

Epithelial tissue is classified into different types based on its structure and function:

* **Simple Epithelium:** Composed of a single layer of cells.
* **Stratified Epithelium:** Composed of multiple layers of cells.

Hormones are chemical messengers that affect the activity of target cells or organs.

Salivary glands, on the other hand, are exocrine glands that secrete their products (saliva) through ducts. Saliva is a clear liquid that helps to lubricate the mouth and break down food.

Therefore, salivary glands are not endocrine glands because they do not secrete their products directly into the bloodstream.

**Additional context:**

The endocrine system is a network of glands that produce and secrete hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to target cells or organs. The endocrine system plays a vital role in regulating many bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, reproduction, and mood.

The major endocrine glands include the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads (ovaries and testes).

Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that are found in connective tissue. They are known for their role in allergic reactions, but they also play a role in inflammation and immunity. Mast cells secrete a variety of substances, including:

* Histamine: Histamine is a vasodilator, which means it causes blood vessels to widen. This can lead to redness, swelling, and itching.
* Tryptase: Tryptase is a protease, which means it breaks down proteins. This can lead to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines.
* Chymase: Chymase is another protease that can break down proteins. It can also activate other inflammatory mediators.

All of these substances can contribute to the symptoms of allergic reactions, such as sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Mast cells can also release other substances, such as serotonin and prostaglandins, which can also contribute to inflammation and allergic reactions.

**Additional Context:**

Mast cells are derived from the same stem cells that give rise to basophils. They are found in connective tissue throughout the body, but they are particularly common in the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Mast cells are activated by a variety of stimuli, including allergens, cytokines, and physical trauma.

**Explanation:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various body structures. It consists of specialized cells called chondrocytes that are embedded in a matrix composed of collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and water.

**Chondroblasts are immature cartilage cells responsible for synthesizing and secreting the matrix.** They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into chondrocytes once they are enclosed within the matrix.

During the development and growth of cartilage, chondroblasts actively produce and secrete components of the matrix, including collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and other glycosaminoglycans. These molecules form a complex interwoven network that provides the characteristic strength and flexibility of cartilage.

The matrix of cartilage is highly hydrated, containing up to 80% water, which contributes to its resilience and shock-absorbing properties. The collagen fibers provide tensile strength, while proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans bind to water, creating a gel-like substance that allows for compression and flexibility.

Chondrocytes, once embedded within the matrix, maintain the integrity of the cartilage by producing and secreting additional matrix components as needed. They also regulate the turnover and degradation of the matrix through enzymes such as metalloproteinases.

**Other important points related to cartilage matrix production:**

* The process of cartilage matrix production is called chondrogenesis.
* The composition and properties of the matrix can vary depending on the type of cartilage (hyaline, elastic, or fibrocartilage).
* Chondroblasts are often found in clusters called chondrogenic zones or nests.
* Once chondroblasts differentiate into chondrocytes, they become trapped within the matrix and lose their ability to divide.
* Cartilage is avascular, meaning it lacks blood vessels, which limits its ability to repair and regenerate.",,False,False,,146,2097,,,,,,Q-bank,,,,False,,7686,Chondrocytes,1918,False,2024-07-02T17:11:46.211+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.211+05:30,False,,7687,Chondroblasts,1918,True,2024-07-02T17:11:46.213+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.213+05:30,False,,7688,Osteocytes,1918,False,2024-07-02T17:11:46.216+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.216+05:30,False,,7689,Histiocytes,1918,False,2024-07-02T17:11:46.218+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.218+05:30,False,,81

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in various parts of the body, such as the joints, ears, and nose. Unlike other tissues, cartilage does not have a blood supply. Instead, it relies on the diffusion of nutrients from the surrounding tissues.

The lack of blood supply in cartilage is due to its unique structure. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. This matrix is very dense and prevents blood vessels from penetrating the tissue.

The lack of blood supply has several implications for cartilage. First, it means that cartilage is very slow to heal. If cartilage is damaged, it can take a long time for it to repair itself. Second, the lack of blood supply makes cartilage susceptible to infection. Bacteria and other microorganisms cannot easily reach cartilage, but if they do, they can cause serious infections that are difficult to treat.

**Additional context:**

Cartilage is divided into three main types:

* **Hyaline cartilage** is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, the ribs, and the nose.
* **Elastic cartilage** is found in the ears and the epiglottis. It is more flexible than hyaline cartilage.
* **Fibrocartilage** is the strongest type of cartilage. It is found in the intervertebral discs and the menisci of the knees.

A sprain is an injury to a ligament, which is a tough band of fibrous tissue that connects bones together. Ligaments help to stabilize joints and prevent excessive movement. When a ligament is stretched or torn beyond its normal range of motion, it can cause a sprain.

**Additional context:**

* Sprains are classified according to their severity:
    * Grade 1: Mild stretching of the ligament without tearing
    * Grade 2: Partial tearing of the ligament
    * Grade 3: Complete tearing of the ligament
* Sprains can occur in any joint, but they are most common in the ankle, knee, and wrist.
* Symptoms of a sprain include pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty moving the joint.
* Treatment for a sprain typically involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a torn ligament.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is present between the adjacent bones of the vertebral column and limbs. It provides a smooth surface for the bones to move against each other and helps to cushion them from impact. Cartilage is also found in other parts of the body, such as the ears, nose, and trachea.

**Additional context:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is composed of cells called chondrocytes. Chondrocytes are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. Collagen is a protein that provides strength and flexibility to the cartilage, while proteoglycans are molecules that attract water and give cartilage its cushioning properties.

Cartilage is avascular, meaning that it does not contain any blood vessels. This means that cartilage cannot repair itself if it is damaged. However, cartilage can be replaced by bone through a process called endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is the process by which bones grow in length during childhood.

**Uses of cartilage:**

* **Provides a smooth surface for bones to move against each other.** Cartilage is found between the ends of bones in joints. It helps to reduce friction and wear and tear on the bones.

Ligaments are tough, fibrous connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They are responsible for providing stability and preventing excessive movement at joints.

If ligaments are cut or broken, the bones they connect will become unfixed. This can lead to instability, pain, and decreased range of motion at the affected joint.

In severe cases, a torn ligament can lead to dislocation of the bones, which is a complete separation of the bones at a joint. This can be a very serious injury that requires immediate medical attention.

Therefore, it is important to protect ligaments from injury by avoiding activities that could put them at risk, such as contact sports or heavy lifting. If you do experience a ligament injury, it is important to see a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated properly.

**Additional context**
The structural organization of animals is a fundamental concept in biology that refers to the way in which the different parts of an animal's body are organized and arranged. Ligaments are just one type of connective tissue that is found in the body. Other types of connective tissue include tendons, cartilage, and bone. Each type of connective tissue has a specific structure and function.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, including the joints, ears, and nose. It is composed of cells called chondroblasts, which are responsible for producing the cartilage matrix. The matrix is made up of collagen fibers and proteoglycans, which give cartilage its strength and flexibility.

Chondroblasts are found in the inner layer of the perichondrium, which is a membrane that surrounds cartilage. When a chondroblast produces enough matrix, it becomes trapped within the matrix and is called a chondrocyte. Chondrocytes are mature cartilage cells that are responsible for maintaining the cartilage matrix.

There are three types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage and is found in the joints, ribs, and trachea. Elastic cartilage is found in the ears and epiglottis and is more flexible than hyaline cartilage. Fibrocartilage is found in the intervertebral discs and knee menisci and is stronger than hyaline cartilage.

Cartilage is an important tissue that plays a role in many functions of the body.

The external ear, also known as the pinna or auricle, is a flexible structure composed of cartilage. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, including the ears, nose, and joints. It is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support and protection to the structures it encloses.

The pinna is made up of a thin layer of skin that covers a framework of cartilage. The cartilage is arranged in a complex shape that helps to collect and funnel sound waves into the ear canal. The shape of the pinna also helps to determine the direction from which sound is coming.

The cartilage of the pinna is elastic, which allows it to withstand bending and twisting forces. This flexibility helps to protect the delicate structures of the inner ear from damage.

* **Striated:** Cardiac muscle cells have a striated appearance due to the arrangement of thick and thin filaments within the cell. This striated appearance is similar to that seen in skeletal muscle cells.
* **Involuntary:** Cardiac muscle cells are involuntary, meaning that they contract automatically without conscious control. This is in contrast to skeletal muscle cells, which are voluntary and can be controlled consciously.

The striated appearance of cardiac muscle cells is due to the arrangement of thick and thin filaments within the cell. The thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin, while the thin filaments are composed of the proteins actin and tropomyosin. The arrangement of these filaments allows for the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction, which is responsible for the contraction of the heart muscle.

The involuntary nature of cardiac muscle cells is due to the presence of pacemaker cells in the heart.

Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles that are attached to the bones. They are used for conscious movements, such as walking, running, and lifting objects. 

Skeletal muscles fatigue quickly because they contain a high proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers. 

Fast-twitch muscle fibers are primarily responsible for rapid but powerful contractions and rely on anaerobic metabolism, which produces energy quickly but also leads to the accumulation of lactic acid as a byproduct. 

As lactic acid accumulates, it lowers the muscle's pH and interferes with its ability to contract, leading to fatigue.

In contrast, slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are found in endurance muscles, have a higher capacity for aerobic metabolism and can sustain contractions for longer periods without fatigue.

Nodes of Ranvier are specialized gaps in the myelin sheath that surrounds the axon of a neuron. Myelin is an insulating layer that helps to speed up the transmission of electrical signals along the nerve fiber. At the Nodes of Ranvier, the myelin sheath is interrupted, which allows the electrical signal to ""jump"" from one node to the next. This process, known as saltatory conduction, makes the transmission of electrical signals much faster than if the signal had to travel through the entire length of the myelin sheath.

**Additional context:**

* The Nodes of Ranvier are named after the French physiologist Louis-Antoine Ranvier, who first described them in 1878.
* The Nodes of Ranvier are found in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons, but they are more common in myelinated axons.
* The distance between the Nodes of Ranvier is typically about 1 millimeter.
* The Nodes of Ranvier play an important role in the transmission of electrical signals along the axon. They help to speed up the signal and prevent it from being lost in the myelin sheath.

**Explanation:**

Centrioles are cylindrical structures that help in organizing microtubules for the formation of cilia and flagella. They are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, except for mature red blood cells and neural cells like neurons.

In neurons, the absence of centrioles is related to their unique function and structure. Neurons are primarily responsible for transmitting electrical impulses, and their shape and structure are optimized for this purpose. The presence of centrioles, which are involved in cell division, would not be beneficial for neurons as they do not undergo cell division once they mature.

The absence of centrioles in neurons is a specialized adaptation that allows them to maintain their structure and function effectively throughout their lifespan.",,False,False,,146,2120,,,,,,Q-bank,,,,False,,7778,Mitochondria,1941,False,2024-07-02T17:11:46.869+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.869+05:30,False,,7779,Ribosome,1941,False,2024-07-02T17:11:46.872+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.872+05:30,False,,7780,Centriole,1941,True,2024-07-02T17:11:46.875+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.875+05:30,False,,7781,Nucleus,1941,False,2024-07-02T17:11:46.878+05:30,2024-07-02T17:11:46.878+05:30,False,,104

Nerve cells, also known as neurons, are the fundamental units of the nervous system. They possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from other cells in the body.

**Axons and Dendrites:**

* **Axons:** These are long, slender extensions that transmit electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons or target cells.
* **Dendrites:** These are short, branched extensions that receive electrical impulses from other neurons.

**Significance:**

Axons and dendrites are essential for the function of neurons in communication and signal transmission. They allow neurons to receive and send electrical signals, enabling the transmission of information throughout the nervous system.

**Additional Context:**

* Nerve cells have a cell body (soma) that contains the nucleus and other organelles.
* They are excitable cells that can generate and conduct electrical impulses (action potentials).

**Synapse:**

* Synapse is the functional connection between two neurons.
* It is a specialized structure that facilitates the transmission of electrical or chemical signals from one neuron to another.
* Synapses can be classified into two types:
    * Electrical synapses: Allow direct electrical connection between neurons.
    * Chemical synapses: Transmit signals through neurotransmitters.

**Importance of Synapses:**

* Synapses play a crucial role in communication between neurons.
* They allow for signal amplification and integration, which is essential for complex neural processing.
* Synapses are highly plastic and can strengthen or weaken over time, a process known as synaptic plasticity.
* Synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory.

**Additional Context:**

**Structure of Synapse:**

* A synapse consists of a presynaptic neuron, a postsynaptic neuron, and a synaptic cleft.
* The presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
* Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing a change in its electrical potential.

**Transmission of Signals:**

* In electrical synapses, electrical signals pass directly from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic neuron through gap junctions.
* In chemical synapses, neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, triggering a series of chemical reactions that lead to a change in the postsynaptic neuron's electrical potential.

Muscle fibres are long, cylindrical cells that make up muscles. They are responsible for the contraction and relaxation of muscles, which allows for movement.

There are three types of muscle fibres: skeletal muscle fibres, cardiac muscle fibres, and smooth muscle fibres.

* **Skeletal muscle fibres** are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements, such as walking, running, and jumping. They are long, cylindrical cells with striations (bands) that are visible under a microscope.
* **Cardiac muscle fibres** are found in the heart and are responsible for the pumping action of the heart. They are also long, cylindrical cells with striations, but they are shorter and thicker than skeletal muscle fibres.
* **Smooth muscle fibres** are found in the walls of hollow organs, such as the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They are not attached to bones and are responsible for involuntary movements, such as digestion and blood flow. They are shorter and thinner than skeletal muscle fibres and do not have striations.

**Therefore, the muscle fibre that tapers at ends and does not show striations is a smooth muscle fibre.**

**Additional context:**

Muscle fibres are composed of myofibrils, which are bundles of myofilaments. Myofilaments are made up of two proteins: actin and myosin. When a muscle fibre contracts, the myosin filaments slide over the actin filaments, causing the muscle to shorten.

The striations in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres are caused by the arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments.
